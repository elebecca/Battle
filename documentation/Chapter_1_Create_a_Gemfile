Create a Gemfile

1. Initialize your project with a Ruby Gemfile. Gemfiles act as a reference for describing all the Gem (libraries) 
dependencies (ie the Gems to be used) in the project.
$ bundle init

2. Use Bundler (a dependency manager) to work with the Gems listed in the Gemfile.
It provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install

3. Use Ruby Version Manager (RVM) to install and manage different versions of Ruby. It allows you to work with multiple ruby environments.
